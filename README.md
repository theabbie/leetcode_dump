## How to use

Clone this repo, `git clone https://github.com/theabbie/leetcode_dump`

Run `yarn` to install all required dependencies.

Run `yarn leetcode` to start the process, it will ask for your leetcode cookie which is required to fetch your submissions, it can be found in your browser storage.

It will ask for the path to save all your code files, enter the path and press Enter.

Wait for some time as it fetches 20 submissions / second, if rate limit is exceeded it will wait for 10 seconds before trying again, this usually happens because csrf token is expired, you may use new cookie and continue from where it stopped (number of submissions fetched already).
